I’m Tushar, a multi-genre writer embracing the messy journey of creation.

My professional path started early as soon as I entered college.

Which led to varied gigs – part-time collaborations, NGO work, internships and lastly got a generalist role for $50 monthly.

That was 3 years ago. Now, I refine brand narratives across social media.

Currently:

- Leading content marketing for [Buildd](https://buildd.co/)
- Formerly managed [Purple Pay](https://x.com/purplepayapp?s=21&t=blFbEqgYvEn7OKOd5e_F0w)’s digital presence
- Written blogs for [Dezerv](https://www.dezerv.in/)
- Previously worked as a marketing generalist for OWLED, where it all started

When not working on my day-job or with clients, you'll find me working on my passion projects – my Podcast [Decoded](https://x.com/podcastdecoded_?s=21&t=blFbEqgYvEn7OKOd5e_F0w) page, an upcoming [newsletter](https://substack.com/@tusharmehta), or just being active on [Twitter](https://x.com/tushaarmehtaa/status/1738942170357531015?s=46&t=blFbEqgYvEn7OKOd5e_F0w).

If my work resonates, let's connect! I promise an experience beyond delivering projects – together, we can create stories that emotionally impact audiences.
